 Climate Pattern Analysis and Weather Prediction Using Data
 Overview

This project focuses on building a scalable and automated data pipeline for weather prediction. It demonstrates how data engineering principles can be applied to collect, clean, transform, and store weather data for forecasting and analytical applications. By ensuring high-quality and accessible data, the system supports decision-making in agriculture, disaster management, and urban planning.

 Objectives

Build a robust data pipeline for real-time and batch weather data.

Ensure data quality, governance, and scalability for analytical use.

Enable visualization and trend analysis through dashboards and APIs.

Provide a foundation for machine learning-based weather forecasting.

 Dataset

Source: weather.csv (historical climate data)

Attributes: Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall, Wind Speed, Pressure, Location, Timestamp

Purpose: Capture long-term weather trends and detect seasonal and anomaly patterns.

 Methodology

Data Ingestion: Using Python, Kafka, or Flume to collect data from CSVs, APIs, or IoT sensors.

Data Storage: Raw data in data lake (Hadoop/S3) → Cleaned data in data warehouse (Snowflake/BigQuery).

ETL/ELT Processing: Data cleaning, unit conversions, timestamp formatting via Apache Spark and Airflow.

Data Modeling: Star schema with fact and dimension tables (Temperature, Rainfall, Humidity, etc.).

Visualization: Power BI / Tableau / Matplotlib / Seaborn dashboards showing real-time trends.

 Findings & Results

Identified seasonal weather patterns such as summer heat and monsoon rainfall.

Detected anomalies like unusual temperature spikes or sudden rainfall.

Delivered interactive dashboards for continuous monitoring and insights.

Demonstrated the role of data pipelines in supporting accurate forecasting.
